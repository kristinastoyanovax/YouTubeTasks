# Exercise 2
Tool: Confluence
Answer:
I have to know what are good outcomes of the algorithm. For example if you watch farm videos should cow videos be recommended to you, etc. etc. I have to know what are the weights of the inputs (user history, watch time, trends, etc.). The feature needs to be approached in more than one way. Different types of user profiles need to be considered (new profiles, diverse profiles, etc).

# Exercise 3

# Exercise 5
Tool: JIRA, any tool for test management (X-ray or JIRA plugin)
Answer:
Let’s say we have X number of days to test this feature.
The team will be divided in four groups and each will have their own part of the feature to test (Create, Edit, Delete, View). Everyday the team of testers will have a quick meeting up to 15min to report their progress. The progress will be tracked in JIRA boards or any other tool that can support this feature.

# Exercise 6
Tool: TBD
Answer: 
I’m not familiar with the monetisation feature. All I know is that users have different brand ratings and that determines their payout per a thousand views.

# Exercise 7
Tool: based on the platform, I’d use the proper automation tooling
Answer: 
I'd set up automation on each of our supported devices and analyse the playback on each of them
The analyzation would also be automated. There must be some statistics we can look up like:
Connection speeds to our server; Buffer health; dropped frames;
